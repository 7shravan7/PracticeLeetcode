/*
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
	Example 1:
		Input: 5
		Output: 2
	Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. 
		So you need to output 2.

	Example 2:
		Input: 1
		Output: 0
	Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. 
	So you need to output 0.
 
Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerís binary representation.
This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
